Summary: Created for my first Bloc capstone, Fur Friendly Spaces is a app for accumulating dog-friendly places of all different kinds in a given city.

The application displays a list of all the dog-friendly places in the database to the user and allows for filtering by location type and/or city. To add a new location, the app leverages the Google Maps API to validate the location and get the correct information (name, address, city). Users can also up-vote and down-vote the existing locations based on their personal experiences to further enrich the value of the app.

Technologies used: React, CSS, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL

Future Goals: Further utilization of the Google Maps API to show a map of the different locations and allow the user to look at a map of all the pinned locations in a given city.
